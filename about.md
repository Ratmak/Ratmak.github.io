<span class="style: background: url('/images/lightlinetom.svg') left/contain no-repeat; opacity='0.2';"></span>Tom is a friendly guy from New Jersey who likes music and some other things. He works all day and parties[^1] all night, just like you do. He's interested in old stuff and new stuff and is always looking to learn.

[^1]: in this context, *partying* is defined as "sleeping poorly - as with sleep apnea"

This website ~~was~~ is probably still being slapped together using a Jekyll theme named Pixyll that was crafted with <3 by [John Otander](http://johnotander.com)
([@4lpine](https://twitter.com/4lpine)).

I encourage you to check out Pixyll's [Github repository](https://github.com/johnotander/pixyll) to download it,
request a feature, report a bug, or contribute. It's free, and open source
