This is my fork of [John Otander](http://johnotander.com)'s lovely [Pixyll](https://www.github.com/johno/pixyll) theme for [Jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com).

It's been a while, and I'm stumbling through most everything I do here. If you're reading this (why would you be doing that?) and you have any helpful suggestions, I'm sure I'd [like to hear them](mailto:z3wkcguwi5y4@opayq.com).
